# zunescape

A Kata implementation that parodies RuneScape that facilitates matchmaking and other interactive elements of an MMORPG through Java. This Kata implementation promotes Object-Oriented Programming principles to create a virtual game world. The application also provides an interface for player objects to join ranked matches and interact with the game environment and other entities.

Initially, a code skeleton was constructed, and then the code was refactored to use advanced techniques such as Abstract Factories, Adapters, Singletons, and so on. This allowed for a more maintainable and extensible codebase. It also improved the code's readability and performance. In addition, it reduced the development time needed for the project, as it reduced redundant code and streamlined previous tedious processes such as matchmaking and communication between players.
